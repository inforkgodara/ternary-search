# ternary-search

A simple single class implementation of ternary search in Java. The user will be prompted to input the number of elements in a list which they want to enter. It is similar to binary search where we divide the array into two parts but in this algorithm. In this, we divide the given array into three parts and determine which has the key (searched element). We can divide the array into three parts by taking middle1 and middle2 which can be calculated as shown below. Initially, l and right will be equal to 0 and length-1 respectively, where length is the length of the array. The user then will choose a element to be searched in the list. The ternary search algorithm will be performed, and the index at which the element was found will be returned or the code will notify that it could not find the element.
